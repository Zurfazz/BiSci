This repository is to make available files to effectivley log and store biological data.
The programs will be made with python.
The files are intended to be easy to use in both laboratory enviorment and doing field work in remote locations probably using android phones.
Until now the file list includes:
SIZExWEIGHT.py with its own branch and readme.
